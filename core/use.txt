To redo an experiment you have to install some dependencies - there is a pyproject.toml for a uv project in the code directory
that installs the required dependencies. Navigate to the code directory and run uv sync to setup a new environment with the 
dependencies. 

This has been tested only under Mac OS X 15.7.3.

1. Run the generate_data.py file. The easiest way to run it is using uv and then

uv run generate_data.py --help 

for all available options.

- use the --federated flag to save per-node data for federated training and the --split flag to split into train/val/test
- for the experiments, a --total-traffic 3000 was used to introduce bottlenecks
- otherwise the default values should represent those used during the experiments

2. Train the centralized model. 

uv run train_centralized.py --data-dir <path to data dir from previous generation command>

3. Evaluate the model 

uv run train_centralized.py --evaluate 

- this will use the best saved model
